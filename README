Welcome to ATLAS Nightly on ARM (ANA).
This will build a version of the ATLAS software for ARM, on ARM (or any other architecture
 you might want).


################################## Layout ################################################
1) Build LCG Stack (assumed completed, not covered here)
#tdaq and dqm common arent completely integreated into ANA, 
#therefore they require a bit of extra work.
2) Build tdaq-common
3) Build dqm-common
4) Build sw_extras (Just geant)
5) Build ATLAS projects (GAUDI, Detcommon etc) 

Appendices:

A1) The Patches
A2) Creating atlas environment scripts

##########################################################################################

1) Done.

>> source Environnemt.sh
(Make sure the paths in that file are correct).

>> cd rel_6; source CheckoutTarBalls.sh

2) tdaq-common:

>> cd patches/tdaq-common-01-*-patches
#Go into each folder, make sure the patch makes sense, then for each do 
>> source *.sh
#Remember to check package versions in paths

>> cd ANA/rel_6/tdaq-common/tdaq-common-01-*
>> cp ../../BuildSetup_tdaq-common.sh . #Correct the paths
>> source BuildSetup_tdaq-common.sh
>> cd TDAQCRelease/cmt
>> cmt config
>> cmt broadcast cmt config
>> cmt broadcast 'make -j6 && make inst'

3) Exact same steps as 2), however copy the BuildSetup_dqm-common.sh script instead.

4) Build sw_extras

>> cd ANA/sw_pacakages
>> source Buildsw_extras.sh #Remember to correct for paths

5) Build ATLAS projects
>> cd ANA/rel_6
>> source BuildAtlasOffline.sh  # see ANA/rel_6/README for more info on what this script does.


Appendices:

A1) The patches can be applied manually (make sure to source Environment.sh first) and automatically. Applying a patch twice and saying (y) will reverse the patch.
Creating patches is a bit annoying unfortunately. From the directory where the "faulty" file is: 

>> diff -u OriginalFile NewFile > OriginalFile.patch
>> patch -b < OriginalFile.patch

Then create a folder in patches/patches-*/ and move the patch in there. Create a template.sh file in same folder so that it get's found by master script when run (copy one from another patch and adjust paths).


A2) Once everything as been built one needs to get the environment variables out such as that in rel_6/PostInstall/. 
>> env > AtlasSetup
Then in a text editor add "export" to beginning of each line adn get rid of unnecessary variables.
