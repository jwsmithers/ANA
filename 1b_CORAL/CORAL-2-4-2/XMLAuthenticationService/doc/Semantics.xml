<sect2><title>XMLAuthenticationService Semantics</title>
<para>
The XMLAuthenticationService component ("CORAL/Services/XMLAuthenticationService")
provides an implementation of
the <emphasis>IAuthenticationService</emphasis> interface which is
based on the parsing of an XML input file, from where a list of known
connection strings is read. For each connection string a user name
and a password are specified in the file.
</para>
<para>In addition to the credentials corresponding to the <emphasis>default</emphasis>
database role, one may define several <emphasis>roles</emphasis> for a given connection string.
</para>

<para>The XML file should have a format like the following:
<screen>
<![CDATA[
<connectionlist>

<connection name="technology1://host1/db1">
  <parameter name="user" value="dbuser1" />
  <parameter name="password" value="dbpasswd1" />
</connection>

<connection name="technology2://host2/db2">
  <parameter name="user" value="dbuser2" />
  <parameter name="password" value="dbpasswd2" />

  <role name="writer">
    <parameter name="user" value="dbuser2_writer" />
    <parameter name="password" value="dbpasswd2_writer" />
  </role>

  <role name="updater">
    <parameter name="user" value="dbuser2_updater" />
    <parameter name="password" value="dbpasswd2_updater" />
  </role>

</connection>
.
.
.
</connectionlist>
]]>
</screen>
</para>

<para>By default the file name of the authentication file that is read
is called <emphasis role="bold">authentication.xml</emphasis>. This however can be changed by setting
accordingly the value of the component's property named <emphasis role="bold">AuthenticationFile</emphasis>.</para>

<para>If the authentication file name does not correspond to an absolute path, the system
will try to search it in the current working directory and then in the
directories defined in the path environment variable <emphasis role="bold">CORAL_AUTH_PATH</emphasis>.</para>

<para>If the authentication file is found in multiple places in the directories specified by CORAL_AUTH_PATH,
then repeated entries are not overriden, but the first one found is kept.
</para>
