<para>
The EnvironmentAuthenticationService component ("CORAL/Services/EnvironmentAuthenticationService")
provides an implementation of the <emphasis>IAuthenticationService</emphasis> interface which is
based on the use of two environment variables. In particular the
database user name and password are retrieved from the environment
variables <emphasis role="bold">CORAL_AUTH_USER</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">CORAL_AUTH_PASSWORD</emphasis> respectively,
completely ignoring what the actual connection string is.
</para>
<para>This implementation is provided mainly to facilitate easy
development of CORAL-based applications.</para>
