The package is based on the the Oracle Call Interface
(OCI) API. The choice was favoured with respect to OCCI, the C++
client library, in order to avoid potential problems which will
arise with the non-availability of the OCCI library for a given
C++ compiler, especially for the Linux platforms. The OCI API allows
the implementation of the POOL Relational Abstraction Layer (RAL)
interfaces in the most efficient way.

<para>The shared library is linked against the Oracle instant client
10.2.0.1 libraries.
