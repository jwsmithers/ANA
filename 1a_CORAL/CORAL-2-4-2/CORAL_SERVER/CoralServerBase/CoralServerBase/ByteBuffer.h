/** @class ByteBuffer ByteBuffer.h
 *
 *  Simple implementation of a byte buffer.
 *  Looseely inspired by the java.nio.Buffer and coral::Blob classes.
 *
 *  A byte buffer is a finite sequence of bytes.
 *  It can be used to write data into it and read data from it.
 *  Apart from its contents, the properties of a ByteBuffer are
 *  its maximum size (capacity) and its used size (append position).
 *
 *  A ByteBuffer's maximum size is the number of allocated bytes.
 *  All of these bytes are safe to be read from or written into
 *  but not all of these bytes are used: bytes that have been
 *  allocated, but not written to, have an undefined content.
 *  The maximum size is never negative, but can be dynamically changed.
 *  Shrinking a buffer will remove trailing bytes after the new maximum size:
 *  this will generally not result in data copies in memory.
 *  Expanding a buffer will append trailing bytes after the old maximum size:
 *  this may result in expensive data copies in memory.
 *
 *  A ByteBuffer's used size is the number of used bytes.
 *  The used size is never negative or greater than its maximum size.
 *  Users who wish to append data 'at the end' of the ByteBuffer
 *  should write at the position of the used size and then increment it.
 *
 *  Writing or reading data from memory beyond the maximum size of the
 *  ByteBuffer may lead to undefined results or access violations.
 *  Writing or reading data from memory beyond the used size of the
 *  ByteBuffer (but within its maximum size) may lead to undefined results.
