              Threading models for CoralServerProxy
              

- the proxy has be multi-threaded for efficient use of the multi-core CPUs

- proxy could use different threading models depending on the expected 
  number of clients/connections/cores/etc.

- possible threading options:
  - one thread per connecton (TPC)
  - one thread per request (TPR)

- thread pool can be an option for the TPR model (could be used for TPC
  model too but may not be too useful)
  
- in TPR model request handling should probably be select-based with 
  select running in a separate thread. Request-processing threads 
  interact with the caching system which has to be synchronized
  
- in TPC model threads only read the data from their corresponding 
  connections and send them into a queue. Queue is processed by the 
  separate hread which also interacts with a cache.
