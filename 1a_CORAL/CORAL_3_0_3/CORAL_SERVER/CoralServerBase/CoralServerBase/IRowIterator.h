  /** @class IRowIterator
   *
   *  Interface to an iterator over rows represented as AttributeList's.
   *
   *  Concrete classes implementing this interface are required to
   *  position the iterator before the first row in the loop:
   *  the nextRow() method must be called to retrieve the first row.
   *
   *  This is similar to the ICursor interface, with two differences:
   *  first, the destructor is public, because the CORAL facade returns
   *  auto-pointers to iterators rather than references to them;
   *  second, there is no close() method, because any server-side cursors
   *  associated to the iterator should be released in the desctructor.
   *
   *  This is also similar to the IByteBufferIterator interface
   *  (iterating over AttributeList's rather than over ByteBuffer's),
   *  with the important difference that there is no isLast() method
   *  because it is not needed and would lead to unnecessary row copies.
